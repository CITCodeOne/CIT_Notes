EF is a set of technologies within ADO.NET designed to simplify the development of data-oriented software applications.

It adresses the common challenge faced by developers who must simultaneously manage the business logic of an application and interact with the underlying data storage systems. 

EF enables developers to work with data using domain-specific objects and properties

> e.g. `Customer` object with an `Adress` property). 

instead of directly manipulating database tables and columns. This approach allows developers to operate at a higher level of abstraction, resulting in less code and more maintainable application.
