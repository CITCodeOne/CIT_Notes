#React
- Is a modular, scalable, flexible, and popular front-end framework
- `createRoot()` from `react-dom/client` can be used to create a React root at the specified DOM element.
- A React root's `render()` method can be used to render JSX on screen.
- The `render()` method only updates DOM elements that have changed using the virtual DOM.

#Javascript 
- Spaghetti code is a computer source code that encodes control flow that is convoluted, and therefore, hard to understand. 

#JSX
- JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript that combines the JavaScript and HTML-like syntax to provide highly functional, reusable markup. It's use to create DOM elements which are then rendered in the React DOM.
- JSX is called a JSX element: `<h1>Hello World</h1>` 
- JSX elements are treated as JavaScript expressions. They can go anywhere that JavaScript expressions can go. Meaning they can be saved in a variable, passed to be a function, stored in an object or array. 
- JSX elements can have attributes, just like HTML. It is written using HTML-like syntax: a name, followed by an equals sign, followed by a value. The value should be wrapped in quotes. `my-attribute-name="my-attribute-value"`
- JSX can be nested. Meaning you can nest JSX elements inside of other JSX elements, just like HTML. It's important to remember that you need to wrap the multiline JSX expression in parentheses. 
- JSX the word render means to make it appear on screen.


#HTML
- #DOM also called Document Object Model, is a tree structure where each HTML tag becomes a node in the hierarchy.
